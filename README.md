# Notices <br />
 > [!NOTE]\
 > Most of these are taken from parts of scripts or broken; some of these scripts are personal scripts for my own use or random scripts I found or recieved
 > I've made my own scripts and added them to the Coryu Made Scripts tab! [Coryu Scripts](https://github.com/Not-Kyle/Streets-Scripts/tree/main/Coryu-Made-Scripts)
 > I also have my own admin script named Wannacry V2. [WANNACRY V2](https://github.com/Not-Kyle/WANNACRY-V2.lua) This script functions exactly like Cyrus or Ciazware


 > [!NOTE]\
 > Thank you all for contributing to this Github repository! I've been thinking about retiring the Luau language entirely because of the executor shortage, as Krampus is 10 dollars a week (which is absurd)
 > I'm still active on Discord and sometimes Roblox [My Roblox](https://www.roblox.com/users/5388525718/profile)
 > If you have any questions or need help with Luau I can try to help, but I am not like the greatest Luau coder ever so do not expect me to know everything
